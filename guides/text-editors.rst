Text is the raw material of the craft of programming.  You should become good at manipulating text.  The first thing you should do is pick a good cross-platform text editor and learn it well.  If you haven't already done so, this guide will help you choose one.  The next thing you should do is learn regular expressions, and the next thing after that is learn UNIX and one of its command shells, probably bash.

Choosing a text editor
======================

I use Emacs, but it has a steep learning curve.  If you want something you'll be productive with quickly try http://www.sublimetext.com/2 or http://www.jedit.org/ .  Many people who insist on using Windows like http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ .

But if you're going to get a computer science or engineering degree, you might as well learn Emacs ( http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ ) or Vim ( http://www.vim.org/ ), the two major editors available on every UNIX platform, Windows, and Mac.  Vim is probably easier.  I'll post tutorials for these soon.

Customizing your text editor
============================

Having a go-to text editor improves your productivity in part because it will be set up with your preferred defaults.  Customization is important because many text editors and IDEs are configured with bad defaults.  Good programmers insist on writing code that is clear and consistently formatted.  Having a well-configured text editor helps you do that.  I'll post specific tips on text editor customization soon.
